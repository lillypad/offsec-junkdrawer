This is a collection of small offensive security tools that I've
put together mostly for my own convenience. Some of them are
my own, others are major or minor variations (or sometimes just
direct copies) on tricks and scripts I've picked up from others.
Where the original source is known, it's attributed.

* /phineas-pty/ implements a gem of a trick that I picked up from
  Phineas Fishers "Hacking Sindicat de Mossos d'Esquadra" video,
  to get a fully functional pty on a reverse netcat shell. This
  script takes care of the listener. The sender can just be a
  garden variety reverse shell. In order to work, it needs to be
  run inside a tmux instance, since it makes use of the tmux
  send-keys command.

* /innocent/ is just an ordinary windows reverse shell launcher,
  written in C, and meant to be compiled using mingw (see the
  Makefile in that directory). I stumbled across it over at
  [[https://www.nulled.to/topic/87972-custom-windows-reverse-shell-backdoor-written-in-c]].
